# .NET ButterCMS Starter Project

This .NET starter project fully integrates with dynamic sample content from your ButterCMS account, including main menu, pages, blog posts, categories, and tags, all with a beautiful, custom theme with already-implemented search functionality. All of the included sample content is automatically created in your account dashboard when you sign up for a free trial of ButterCMS.

You can view a [live demo hosted on Heroku](https://dotnet-starter-buttercms-tmp.herokuapp.com), or you can click the button below to deploy your own copy of our starter project to the provider of your choice.

### 5.) Previewing and Draft Changes

By default, your starter project is set up to allow previewing of draft changes saved in your ButterCMS.com account. To disable this functionality, set `ButterCMSPreview` value to `false` in your environment variables or `appsettings.json`. Note that a value set in your environment variables takes precedence over `appsettings.json`.

To set in environment variables on **Mac/Linux**:

```console
$ export ButterCMSPreview=false
```

To set in environment variables on **Windows**:

```console
$ set ButterCMSPreview=false
```
